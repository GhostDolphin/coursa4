# blackJack by GhostDolphin (Данило Чогадзе IM-13)

  Simple BlackJack simulator to test my programming skills and hopefully defend the coursework at university.
  
[!] NOT AN ACTUAL GAMBLING GAME - ALL THE FEATURES OF MONEY ARE UNREAL AND PRESENTED JUST FOR THE PROGRAMMING'S SAKE!

[!] The project by default considers that the simulated dealer stops picking cards at the own score of 17 or more.

[!] Player by default starts with the simulated amount of $1000 and all the further bids are restricted to $100.

[!] Some common BlackJack features are not presented at the moment due to the lack of time:
- 'Split' action is not featured;
- 'Double' action is not featured as well (and in my opinion it's completely useless if you don't play for a real result);
- Defence from dealer's blackjack (score of 21 with only 2 cards) is absent;
- ... and all the other things I simply missed while researching on how the game works
